    "**Key Instructions**:\n",
    "1. **Process All Sections and Subsections**:\n",
    "   - Every item in `section_detail` must be reflected in the final JSON.\n",
    "   - Do not skip any sections or subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Section Summaries**:\n",
    "   - For each top-level section, there is some introductory or overarching content. \n",
    "   - In the `detail` field, produce a concise, high-level summary of that content — not line by line, but ensuring no critical points are lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subsection Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Subsections may contain or be identified by “k” (for requirements) or “EK” (for evaluation requirements). These are priority areas.\n",
    "   - Whenever you see `k` or `EK` in a subsection name (or the context implies it):\n",
    "       - Break down any paragraphs into separate, sentence-level requirements/evaluation requirements.\n",
    "       - Preserve numeric data exactly (e.g., “4.54” remains “4.54”).\n",
    "       - Keep wording as close as possible to the original; do not over-paraphrase.\n",
    "       - If a requirement or evaluation requirement is expired, replace its entire text with `\"Expired\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Requirements Missed**:\n",
    "   - Do not omit any requirement/evaluation requirement from `k` or `EK` subsections.\n",
    "   - If the entire subsection text is purely requirements, break it into bullet-like entries (one per sentence or logical statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Format & Merging**:\n",
    "   - Don't include bullet points and all only strings and Also the sentence should be a valid and understandable enough. \n",
    "   - Use the `section_detail` JSON as the basis. Do not remove or overwrite existing data; only append or update where needed.\n",
    "   - Output must be valid JSON following the `format_instructions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Extraneous Data**:\n",
    "   - Only include data from the given `context`. \n",
