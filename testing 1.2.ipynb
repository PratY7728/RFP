    "   - Every item in `section_detail` must be reflected in the final JSON.\n",
    "   - Do not skip any sections or subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Section Summaries**:\n",
    "   - For each top-level section, there is some introductory or overarching content. \n",
    "   - In the `detail` field, produce a concise, high-level summary of that content — not line by line, but ensuring no critical points are lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subsection Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Subsections may contain or be identified by “k” (for requirements) or “EK” (for evaluation requirements). These are priority areas.\n",
    "   - Whenever you see `k` or `EK` in a subsection name (or the context implies it):\n",
    "       - Break the entire subsection content into *meaningful, sentence-level* requirements/evaluation requirements.\n",
    "       - Do not skip or merge entirely separate statements, but also ensure no requirement is fragmented (e.g., bullet points for one requirement should become a single coherent sentence).\n",
    "       - Preserve numeric data exactly (e.g., “4.54” remains “4.54”).\n",
    "       - Keep wording as close as possible to the original; do not over-paraphrase.\n",
    "       - If a requirement or evaluation requirement is expired, replace its entire text with `\"Expired\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Requirements Missed**:\n",
    "   - You must not omit any requirement or evaluation requirement that appears in a `k` or `EK` subsection.\n",
    "   - If the entire subsection text is purely requirements, break it down into one entry per sentence or logical statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Bullet Points**:\n",
    "   - If a single requirement is spread out over multiple lines or bullet points, merge them into a single coherent statement or minimal set of sentences while preserving the original meaning.\n",
    "   - Do not use additional bullet symbols or list markers. \n",
    "   - Numeric references and key phrases must remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Format & Merging**:\n",
    "   - Output each requirement/evaluation requirement as a plain string (no bullet points). \n",
    "   - Ensure each sentence is valid and understandable enough to stand on its own.\n",
    "   - Use the `section_detail` JSON as the basis. Do not remove or overwrite existing data; only append or update where needed.\n",
    "   - Output must be valid JSON following the `format_instructions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **No Extraneous Data**:\n",

Co-Location\\nmeans Services in relation to physical data center facilities as well as associated service, advisory\\nand security services, such as the provision of physical security, perimeter security, physical\\naccess control and monitoring. When delivering Co-Location, the Supplier must handle all\\nunderlying operation and maintenance of fixed installations that enable the Customer to operate,\\nmaintain and support its own data center solution in the Supplier\\'s data center facilities through the\\nprovision of housing Services, including for example physical floor space, racks, cages, premises,\\npower and cooling where the Customer can install his own IT equipment.\\nK-1 General requirements for Co-Location\\nThe Supplier must deliver Co-Location under the Delivery Contract via the data centers described\\nin Annex 12.c.i (Supplier\\'s solution description). The supplier must:\\na. handle all Operational Processes that are relevant in connection with Co-Location, cf.\\nappendix 4.c (Operational Processes)\\nb. ensure monitoring of all Co-Location, including compliance with all KPIs related to Co-\\nLocation. As part of the monitoring, the Supplier must, among other things, but not exclusively:\\nin. create alarms based on the underlying suppliers\\' and/or manufacturers\\'\\nbest practice\\nii. set up other alarms so that the Supplier can proactively carry out mitigating\\nactions as well as other alarms that may be necessary to meet the Customer\\'s requirements for\\nthe Supplier\\'s delivery of Services and reporting under the Supply Contract.\\nc. provide the necessary assistance to the Customer and the Customer\\'s Other Suppliers, e.g. in\\nconnection with Root Cause Analyses, including Root Cause Analyzes in relation to security\\nincidents related to the Supplier\\'s own equipment (e.g. failure of power supply, failure of UPS,\\nbreakdown in cooling, burglary and access by unauthorized persons).\\nK-2 The supplier\\'s advice\\nVersion 1.0 Side 3 of 23\\nThe Supplier must advise the Customer within Co-Location, including how the Customer can\\noptimize its Co-Location with regard to operational reliability, performance and price, e.g. optimal\\nplacement of equipment in rack cabinets in relation to e.g. current load and expedient utilization of\\nthe ongoing development of data center technology.\\nK-3 The supplier\\'s certifications\\nThe supplier must be ISO/IEC 27001 certified or equivalent, or comply with the rules and\\nguidelines of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.\\nVersion 1.0 Side 4 of 23\\nEK-1 The supplier\\'s certifications\\nThe Supplier must document its current ISO/IEC 27001 certification\\nor equivalent, or document how the Supplier ensures compliance and\\ncompliance with the rules and guidelines in the ISO/IEC 27001\\nstandard.\\nThe supplier must also document the offered data center\\'s compliance\\nwith the tier III standard, or higher, as specified by the Uptime\\nInstitute or similar organization.\\nIn connection with the evaluation of the Supplier\\'s response, it is\\npositively weighted if:\\n· The supplier is ISO/IEC 27001 certified or equivalent, cf. K-3.\\n· The Supplier can in other ways document how the Supplier\\nensures compliance with the rules and guidelines in the\\nISO/IEC 27001 standard, cf. K-3.\\n· The supplier has a Tier III certification for the data center offered,\\ncf. K-5\\n· The supplier can otherwise document Tier III compliance for the\\ndata center offered, cf. K-5.\\nThe Customer will make an assessment of the Supplier\\'s response in\\nconnection with the evaluation of Annex 12.c (Co-Location). The\\nassessment is made in relation to the sub-criterion relating to Quality.\\nIt is recommended that the Supplier limit its response to 5 Pages.\\nThe supplier must insert its response to the evaluation requirement\\nin appendix 12.c.i (Description of the supplier\\'s solution).\\nK-4 Provisioning and decommissioning of the Customer\\'s IT equipment\\nThe supplier must ensure provisioning and decommissioning of the Customer\\'s IT equipment,\\nincluding racks and floor space as described in K-11 and K-12.\\nVersion 1.0 Side 5 of 23\\nK-5 Supplier\\'s data centers\\nThe supplier must provide Co-Location equivalent to the tier III standard or higher as specified by\\nthe Uptime Institute or equivalent organization. This implies that the data center\\'s infrastructure\\ncomponents must be able to be maintained simultaneously and that the Supplier\\'s Co-Location\\nmust contain:\\n1. Redundant and independent power supply (UPS), automatic transfer switches (ATS) and\\nbattery to ensure uninterrupted transition to secondary emergency power in case of power loss,\\ninterruptions and peak load periods. The UPS system must be sized to be able to supply the data\\ncenter\\'s total consumption for the necessary period until emergency generator power is phased in.\\n2. Redundant emergency power generator such as oil/diesel generator for power generation as\\nwell as fuel storage and refueling facilities. The emergency power generators must be able to take\\nover the load of the data center from the UPS before it runs out of power, incl. an appropriate\\nmargin of safety. The emergency power generators must be equipped with flicker-free feedback to\\nthe power from the data center\\'s power grid company. The emergency power generator system\\nmust be sized to be able to supply the data center\\'s total consumption.\\n3.
